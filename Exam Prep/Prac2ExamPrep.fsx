    Question 4
    a. Referential transperency == the ability for a symbol to be replaced with a value anywhere in code
    b. Pure Function = is a function that does not ahave any visible side effects and always terminates with the same answere when given a specific input
    c. Immutable value == a value that doesnt change
    d. Higher order funtion = is any function that takes in a function as input an would return a function as input
    e. Base case = A branch of code where a recursive call is not made
    f. Fucntion Composition = an ability in functuional programming which allows for two functions to be combined resultin in one composed function
    g. 
    
    Question 5
    a. yes
    b. a situation where i would use Unit as a function input would be in delaying a function, 
        in a way i would partially apply a function and onlyu execute that functipon if i pass
        in a unit vakue. a scenario where i canuse a unit as an output would be when..
    c. one would use a pipe line sign when readfability is a priority, say we have a code whenre you passing along many inputs to different function in 
        a single line now for readability sake it wpould be wwise to use forward/bakward piping
